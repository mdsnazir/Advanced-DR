Advanced demand response algorithms to control residential loads, with focus on Thermostatically-Controlled-Loads (TCLs)

This MATLAB code base provides some foundational blocks and examples for modeling and controlling the dynamics of a large population of TCLs such as air-conditioners, water-heaters, refrigerators and HVAC systems.
